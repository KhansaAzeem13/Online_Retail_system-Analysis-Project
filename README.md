🛍️ Customer Segmentation Dashboard with K-Means Clustering 🎯
Welcome to the Online Retail Customer Segmentation Dashboard! 🚀 This interactive and visually engaging Streamlit web application leverages unsupervised machine learning to uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior. From EDA to Clustering, everything is integrated into one seamless, user-friendly experience. 🔍

🗂 Features of the Dashboard
📂 Upload and Explore Data
Easily upload your CSV file of online retail data.

Instantly preview the dataset with shape, column types, and sample rows.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Dive deep into the dataset with comprehensive and insightful visualizations:

📊 Histograms to explore feature distributions

🔵 Scatter plots for trend and feature relationships

📦 Box plots and 🎻 violin plots for identifying outliers

📈 Line plots for time-based sales and customer behavior trends

🔥 Correlation heatmap to identify multicollinearity and strong associations

🚩 Missing value analysis with handling strategies

🔎 Outlier detection using visualization techniques

🧩 Pairwise feature relationships (e.g., UnitPrice vs. Quantity)

📅 Grouped aggregations like total sales by Country, CustomerID, or time

🔢 Data type checks and unique value counts to understand data structure

🤖 K-Means Clustering Model for Customer Segmentation
Applied K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on behavior.

Determined optimal number of clusters (k) using the Elbow Method 📉

Trained the clustering model on scaled customer metrics

Visualized results in 2D space using PCA

Supports real-time cluster prediction based on user input via Streamlit

📌 Conclusion and Insights
Segments customers into meaningful groups: e.g., top spenders, frequent buyers, one-time purchasers

Helps businesses design targeted marketing strategies and personalized offers

Suggestions provided for enhancing the model and incorporating RFM features in future versions
